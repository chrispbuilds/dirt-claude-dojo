# Welcome to Your Programming Journey

You are about to learn programming from first principles. No magic. No hidden complexity. Just you, your terminal, and step-by-step discovery.

## Your First Command

Type this exactly:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

What happened? You just made the computer speak.

## Make It Permanent

Now let's save this achievement:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > my-first-program.txt
```

Check if it worked:

```bash
cat my-first-program.txt
```

ðŸŽ‰ **You just created your first program file!**

## What's Next?

You choose your own adventure:

- **A)** Learn about files: `cat lessons/files.md`
- **B)** Learn about variables: `cat lessons/variables.md`  
- **C)** Learn about commands: `cat lessons/commands.md`

Or explore on your own. Every programmer's journey is unique.
