# Dirt Claude Dojo ðŸ¥·

From dirt claude poor to 10x developer - Master CLI fundamentals with LLM partnership, not copy-paste dependency.

git clone https://github.com/chrispbuilds/dirt-claude-dojo.git
cd dirt-claude-dojo  
./dojo-simulator.sh init
```

## Philosophy: Dirt Claude to 10x Developer

Learn to use LLMs as a thinking partner, not a crutch. Master fundamentals through deliberate practice.

### Core Principles
- **NO_COPY_PASTE**: Type everything manually to build muscle memory
- **LEARNING_BY_BUILDING**: Curriculum self-constructs as you progress  
- **SOCRATIC_METHOD**: Claude guides you to answers, never provides them directly
- **PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE**: Features unlock based on proven mastery
- **CONTEXT_PRESERVATION**: Maintain learning state across sessions

## Structure

- `curriculum/` - Lesson plans and learning materials
- `scripts/` - Environment setup and utility scripts  
- `practice/` - Student workspace and exercises
- `data/` - Sample data for processing practice
- `exercises/` - Advanced challenges and projects

## Usage

Each day builds on the previous, creating scripts that preserve and recreate the learning environment. Perfect for:
- Self-paced learning
- LLM-assisted education
- Team training programs
- Educational tool development
