# Dirt Claude Dojo ðŸ¥·

From dirt claude poor to 10x developer - Learn programming from first principles. No magic, no shortcuts, just you and your curiosity.

## Start Here

```bash
cat start.md
```

That's it. Everything else you build yourself.

## Philosophy

Real programmers build their own tools. You'll start with `echo "Hello World"` and gradually build the infrastructure to track your own progress.

### Core Principles
- **NO_COPY_PASTE**: Type everything to build muscle memory
- **FIRST_PRINCIPLES**: Start simple, build complexity gradually
- **CHOOSE_YOUR_PATH**: Every lesson offers multiple directions
- **BUILD_YOUR_TOOLS**: Create the infrastructure as you learn

## What You'll Build

As you progress, you'll create:
- Your own progress tracking system
- Custom learning scripts
- Personal development tools
- Project management utilities

All from scratch. All by hand. All understood.
