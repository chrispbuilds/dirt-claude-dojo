# Dirt Claude Dojo 🥷

From dirt clod poor to 10x developer - Master CLI fundamentals with LLM partnership, not copy-paste dependency.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url] dirt-claude-dojo
cd dirt-claude-dojo  
./dojo init
```

## Philosophy: Dirt Clod to 10x Developer

Learn to use LLMs as a thinking partner, not a crutch. Master fundamentals through deliberate practice.

### Core Principles
- **NO_COPY_PASTE**: Type everything manually to build muscle memory
- **LEARNING_BY_BUILDING**: Curriculum self-constructs as you progress  
- **SOCRATIC_METHOD**: Claude guides you to answers, never provides them directly
- **PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE**: Features unlock based on proven mastery
- **CONTEXT_PRESERVATION**: Maintain learning state across sessions
