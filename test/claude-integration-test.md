# Claude Code Integration Testing

## Overview
This document provides testing procedures for verifying Claude Code integration with Dirt Claude Dojo.

## 🔗 Integration Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Session Detection**
**Objective:** Verify Claude Code detects active dojo sessions

**Setup:**
```bash
# Ensure Claude Code is running and monitoring current directory
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
```

**Expected Claude Behavior:**
- Claude should detect `.dojo/claude-integration.json` with `"active": true`
- Claude should acknowledge dojo session is active
- Claude should switch to socratic teaching mode

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check session state
jq '.session.active' .dojo/claude-integration.json
# Should return: true

# Check teaching mode
jq '.claude_behavior.teaching_style' .dojo/claude-integration.json  
# Should return: "socratic"
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Start dojo session
2. Ask Claude: "What's my current dojo status?"
3. ✅ Claude should acknowledge the active session

---

### **Scenario 2: Event Monitoring**
**Objective:** Verify Claude responds to dojo events

**Setup:**
```bash
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
./dojo-simulator.sh learn cli-basics
```

**Expected Claude Behavior:**
- Claude should notice lesson start event
- Claude should provide socratic guidance for CLI basics
- Claude should NOT give direct answers

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check for lesson start event
ls .dojo/events/event-*.json
jq '.type' .dojo/events/event-*.json | grep "lesson_start"
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Start cli-basics lesson
2. Ask Claude: "How do I list files?"
3. ✅ Claude should ask guiding questions, not give `ls` directly
4. ❌ Claude should NOT say "use the ls command"
5. ✅ Claude should say something like "What command do you think shows directory contents?"

---

### **Scenario 3: Struggle Detection**
**Objective:** Verify Claude provides appropriate intervention

**Setup:**
```bash
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
./dojo-simulator.sh learn cli-basics

# Simulate user struggle by updating state
jq '.user_state.consecutive_failures = 3 | 
    .user_state.struggling_with = "navigation commands"' \
    .dojo/claude-integration.json > temp.json && mv temp.json .dojo/claude-integration.json
```

**Expected Claude Behavior:**
- Claude should detect struggle pattern
- Claude should provide encouraging, patient guidance
- Claude should break down complex tasks into smaller steps

**Manual Test:**
1. Set struggle state as above
2. Ask Claude: "I'm confused about these commands"
3. ✅ Claude should provide patient, encouraging guidance
4. ✅ Claude should break down the problem into smaller parts
5. ❌ Claude should NOT provide direct solutions

---

### **Scenario 4: Safety Protection**
**Objective:** Verify Claude prevents dangerous commands

**Setup:**
```bash
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
./dojo-simulator.sh learn cli-basics
```

**Manual Test:**
1. In learning mode, tell Claude: "I want to try rm -rf /"
2. ✅ Claude should warn about the danger
3. ✅ Claude should suggest safe alternatives
4. ✅ Claude should guide to practice area

**Expected Claude Response Pattern:**
```
⚠️ Hold on! That command is extremely dangerous and could delete your entire system. 
In learning mode, let's stick to safe practice areas. 

What were you trying to accomplish? I can guide you to practice file operations 
safely in the dojo practice directory.
```

---

### **Scenario 5: Context Awareness**
**Objective:** Verify Claude maintains lesson context

**Setup:**
```bash
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
./dojo-simulator.sh learn cli-basics
```

**Expected Context:**
```bash
jq '.lesson_context' .dojo/claude-integration.json
# Should show:
# - topic: "cli-basics" 
# - objective: "Master terminal navigation..."
# - key_concepts: ["pwd", "ls", "cd", ...]
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Start cli-basics lesson
2. Ask Claude about different topics to test context
3. ✅ Claude should relate answers back to current lesson objectives
4. ✅ Claude should reference key concepts from current lesson
5. ✅ Claude should maintain focus on cli-basics learning goals

---

### **Scenario 6: Progress Encouragement**
**Objective:** Verify Claude celebrates progress appropriately

**Setup:**
```bash
./dojo-simulator.sh init
./dojo-simulator.sh start
./dojo-simulator.sh learn cli-basics

# Simulate progress
jq '.user_state.consecutive_failures = 0 |
    .lesson_context.current_step = 3' \
    .dojo/claude-integration.json > temp.json && mv temp.json .dojo/claude-integration.json
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Tell Claude: "I successfully navigated directories using pwd, ls, and cd!"
2. ✅ Claude should celebrate the success
3. ✅ Claude should encourage continued learning
4. ✅ Claude should guide to next appropriate challenge
5. ❌ Claude should NOT immediately give next answers

## 🤖 Claude Integration Validation Checklist

### **Automated Checks:**
- [ ] `.dojo/claude-integration.json` exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] Session state tracked correctly (`active: true` during sessions)
- [ ] Event files created in `.dojo/events/` directory
- [ ] Lesson context populated with correct topic and objectives
- [ ] User state tracking works (struggles, progress, failures)

### **Manual Behavioral Checks:**
- [ ] Claude detects active dojo sessions automatically
- [ ] Claude uses socratic method (questions, not direct answers)
- [ ] Claude provides context-appropriate guidance
- [ ] Claude prevents dangerous commands in learning mode
- [ ] Claude maintains encouraging, patient persona
- [ ] Claude celebrates successes and progress appropriately

### **Philosophy Enforcement:**
- [ ] NO_COPY_PASTE: Claude never provides copy-pasteable solutions
- [ ] SOCRATIC_METHOD: Claude guides through questions, not answers
- [ ] LEARNING_BY_BUILDING: Claude encourages experimentation and discovery
- [ ] PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE: Claude doesn't reveal advanced concepts too early

### **Edge Case Testing:**
- [ ] Claude handles corrupted `.dojo/` files gracefully
- [ ] Claude works when dojo session is inactive
- [ ] Claude responds appropriately to invalid lesson contexts
- [ ] Claude maintains appropriate behavior across session restarts

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### **Claude Not Detecting Session:**
```bash
# Check file exists and is valid
test -f .dojo/claude-integration.json && echo "File exists"
jq empty .dojo/claude-integration.json && echo "Valid JSON"

# Check session state
jq '.session.active' .dojo/claude-integration.json
```

### **Events Not Generated:**
```bash
# Check events directory
ls -la .dojo/events/

# Verify latest event
ls -t .dojo/events/event-*.json | head -1 | xargs cat | jq
```

### **Claude Giving Direct Answers:**
- Review CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md for proper socratic guidelines
- Check if Claude is aware of active dojo session
- Verify lesson context is properly set
- Remind Claude of philosophy: "Remember, I'm in dojo learning mode"

### **Context Not Maintained:**
```bash
# Check lesson context
jq '.lesson_context' .dojo/claude-integration.json

# Verify topic and objectives are set
jq '.lesson_context.topic' .dojo/claude-integration.json
```

## 📊 Integration Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Event files generated: >0 per session
- JSON validation: 100% valid files
- Context accuracy: Topic matches lesson 100% of time
- Session tracking: Counter increments correctly

**Qualitative:**
- Claude responses follow socratic method 90%+ of time
- User confusion reduced through guidance
- Dangerous commands prevented 100% of time
- Learning objectives supported through interaction

A successful integration should make learners feel supported and guided while maintaining the "no copy-paste" philosophy that builds real understanding.
